## Description

This is a second attempt at create a portfolio to use in a professional setting. It includes a header with a logo and "hamburger" that opens the internal links. It also has a link to download my resume for potential employers.

The next section is an introduction, including my name a job title. It is followed by a hero section and the about me section, which gives people a small introduction to who I am.

Finally, there is a section that includes links to my work, which will be updated periodically. There are also various forms of contact in the footer.
