# Portfolio v2

## Description

This is a second attempt at create a portfolio to use in a professional setting. It includes a header with a logo and "hamburger" that opens the internal links. It also has a link to download my resume for potential employers.

The next section is an introduction, including my name a job title. It is followed by a hero section and the about me section, which gives people a small introduction to who I am.

Finally, there is a section that includes links to my work, which will be updated periodically. There are also various forms of contact in the footer.

The website utilizes HTML, CSS, minimal JS, and some fonts and icons pulled from various sources.
